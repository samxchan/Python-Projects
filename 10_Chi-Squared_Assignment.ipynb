    "A parent advisory board for a university was concerned about the effect of part-time jobs on the academic achievement of students attending the university. To obtain some information, the advisory board surveyed a simple random sample of 200 of the more than 20,000 students attending the university. Each student reported the average number of hours spent working part-time each week and his or her perception of the effect of part-time work on academic achievement. The data in the table below summarize the studentsâ€™ responses by average number of hours worked per week (less than 11, 11 to 20, more than 20) and perception of the effect of part-time work on academic achievement (positive, no effect, negative)."
